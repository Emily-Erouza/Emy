# Introduction
- Today I was busy with  FCC(Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets),typing club and sudoku

# Body
- Today I continued with the SASS(fcc).

- I learned about applying a Style Until a Condition is Met with @while, which @while directive is an option with similar  functionality to the JavaScript while loop. It creates CSS rules until a condition is met.

-  I learned that the @each directive loops over each item in a list or map.The variable gets assigned to the current value from the list or map.

- Partials in Sass are separate files that hold segments of CSS code.partials start with the underscore (_) character, which tells Sass it is a small segment of CSS and not to convert it into a CSS file.

- My typing club:
speed: 30wpm
Accuracy: 98%

## Challenge 
 - I had a challenge in sudoku. Where I can't able to put the numbers in a row or colums. So far I am busy trying to practise until I know it.
- I also had a challenge in Sass(fcc), Its to hard to understand it. But I will go back and try to understand it.


# Conclusion
- Tomorrow i will continue with react(FCC)
