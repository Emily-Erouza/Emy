# Introduction
- Today i learned more about logical operations and functions.

# Body
- I learned about logical AND(&&) ,logical OR(||) , logical NOT (!).
- Which their output are:  (A && B) => false
(A || B) => true
!(A && B ) => true

- I learned more about functions ,which is a group of reusable code which can be called anywhere in your program.
- It allow a program to divide a big program into a number of small and manageable functions.
