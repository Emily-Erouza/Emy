# Introduction
Today I learned about a palindrome  which is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

# Body
- Examples of palindrome:Eye, Racecar and A Man, A Plan, A Canal – Panama!

- I learned that  palindrome is valid whether or not its casing reads the same forwards or backwards. So "Racecar" is valid even though it's technically spelt "racecaR" backwards.

- "A Man, A Plan, A Canal – Panama!" is valid because we examine it without any marks or spaces.

- I also learned about this new word called "alphanumeric" which means "letters and numbers", so anything from a-z and 0-9 is an alphanumeric character.
 
 -  I learned how to lowercase something in JavaScript.We can use lowercase in input before doing anything else. We can  store the lowercase version in a variable called "alphanumericOnly" because we are  eventually going to remove alphanumeric characters too.

 -I learned about Regular Expression which  is a  sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Also known as "Regex".

 # Conclusion
 Some examples of palindromic words are redivider, deified, civic, radar, level, rotor, kayak, reviver, racecar, madam, and refer.
