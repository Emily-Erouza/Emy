# Introduction
Today i learned about Basic Algorithm Scripting in JS.

# Body
-  I learned how to Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit : The formula to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit is the temperature in Celsius times 9/5, plus 32.

- Factorialize a Number : If the integer is represented with the letter n, a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!

For example : 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120
- Truncate a String : Truncate a string (first argument) if it is longer than the given maximum string length (second argument). Return the truncated string with a ... ending.

- Finders Keepers : Create a function that looks through an array arr and returns the first element in it that passes a 'truth test'. This means that given an element x, the 'truth test' is passed if func(x) is true. If no element passes the test, return undefined.

- Falsy Bouncer : Falsy values in JavaScript are false, null, 0, "", undefined, and NaN.
