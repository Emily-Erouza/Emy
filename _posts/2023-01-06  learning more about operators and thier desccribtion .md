# Introduction
Today I learned more about operators and their meaning in javascript. Just to remind my self.

# Body
- I learned about (++Increment) > Increases an integer value by one. Ex: A++ will give 11	
 (Decrement--) > Decreases an integer value by one. Ex: A-- will give 9

 - (= = Equal) > Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if yes, then the condition becomes true.Ex: (A == B) is not true.
	
- (!= Not Equal) > Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true.Ex: (A != B) is true.
	
- > (Greater than) Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand, if yes, then the condition becomes true. Ex: (A > B) is not true.
	
- < (Less than) Checks if the value of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand, if yes, then the condition becomes true. Ex: (A < B) is true.
	
 - >= (Greater than or Equal to) Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand, if yes, then the condition becomes true. Ex: (A >= B) is not true.
	
 - <= (Less than or Equal to) Checks if the value of the left operand is less than or equal to the value of the right operand, if yes, then the condition becomes true. Ex: (A <= B) is true.
