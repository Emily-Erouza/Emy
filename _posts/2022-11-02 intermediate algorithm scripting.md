# Introduction
- Today i learned intermeadiate algorithm scrirpting. 
- Algorithm scripting is basically a way of creating a function that takes a variety of inputs and gives a variety of outputs. It's like a function in math except it can take in a lot of different types of data, such as arrays, strings, numbers and so on.

# Body
## I learned about the following concept:
- Sum All Odd Fibonacci Number:A positive integer num, return the sum of all odd Fibonacci numbers that are less than or equal to num.
- Sum All Primes:A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 with exactly two divisors: 1 and itself. For example, 2 is a 
prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 2. In contrast, 4 is not prime since it is divisible by 1, 2 and 4.
- Drop it:the array arr, iterate through and remove each element starting from the first element (the 0 index) until the function func returns true when the iterated element is passed through it.
- Arguments Optional:If only one argument is provided, then return a function that expects one argument and returns the sum.
                    :For example, addTogether(2, 3) should return 5, and addTogether(2) should return a function.
                  var sumTwoAnd = addTogether(2);
                  sumTwoAnd(3) returns 5.

- Map the Debris:Kepler's Third Law, the orbital period  T  of two point masses orbiting each other in a circular or elliptic orbit is:
          :T=2πa3μ−−−√
       :a  is the orbit's semi-major axis
        μ=GM  is the standard gravitational parameter
        G  is the gravitational constant,
        M  is the mass of the more massive body.

 # Conclusion
 The basics of algorithmic thinking, along with OOP and Functional Programming, test your skills with the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting challenges.
