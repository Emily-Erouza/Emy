# Introduction
- Today I was busy with frontend mentor and bootstrap.

 # Body
- I had a session with Mark,base on the Assignment he gave us.
- So far i'm done with the frontend mentor io.
- I was busy with the boos trap(FCC).
- Today I learned about grid to put elements Side By Side,for example Bootstrap's col-md-* class. Here, md means "medium", and * is a "number" specifying how many columns wide the element should be.
- In the Cat Photo App that we're building, we'll use col-xs-*, where xs means "extra small" (like an extra-small mobile phone screen), and * is the "number of columns" specifying how many columns wide the element should be.

# Conclusion
Tomorrow i will continue with Bootstrap.
