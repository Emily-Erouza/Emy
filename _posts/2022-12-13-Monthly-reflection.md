# Introduction
Today we were doing monthly reflection with Tin

# Body
- My highlights of this month.I was quite impressed to finish each section in half of time.I had some previous exprienced  in CSS and HTML. While Lehlogonolo and kgothatso  they were busy helping me and busy giving me test to do. Which this is great way to learn and it definetly help me to improved my learning experience.

- Challenges I have faced so far.I had some previous challenges in Javasript.It so frustating when you are given a challenge and you dont know how to complete it.So far I was busy pushing and try to understand.

# Conclusion
I will go back from the begging of javascript.Learn it again until I understand.
