# Introduction
- Today I was busy with  FCC(Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets) and typing 

# Body
-  In Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets you will learn how to store data in variables, nest CSS, create reusable styles with mixins, add logic and loops to your styles, and more.

-  I learned about Sass, variables start with a $ followed by the variable name.If the color is changed, the only place to edit the code is the variable value. I also learned that  mixin is a group of CSS declarations that can be reused throughout the style sheet. Evrytime you should start with @mixin followed by a custom name parameters (the $x, $y, $blur). How to Use @if and @else to Add Logic To Your Styles.

- How to create @for Sass Loop. @for is used in two ways: "start through end" or "start to end". The main difference is that the "start to end" excludes the end number as part of the count, and "start through end" includes the end number as part of the count.

## Challenges
 - When it comes to @if statments and @for loops. I have a  very big challenge cause i dont understand.
