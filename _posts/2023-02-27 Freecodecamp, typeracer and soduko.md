# Introduction
- Today I was busy with  FCC, typing and soduku.

# Body
- Today I was busy with  jQuery. I learned about addClass() function, when you want to remove them with jQuery's,removeClass() function. How to change the CSS of an HTML element directly with jQuery, you add a function called .css() that allows you to change the CSS of an element. I learned that appendTo() it allows you to select HTML elements and append them to another element.We have a function called children() that allows you to access the children of whichever element you've selected. 

## Challenges
