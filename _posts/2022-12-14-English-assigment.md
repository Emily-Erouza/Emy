# Introduction
Today I did an assignment that Tarryn Hatchett gave us.

# Body
- The assignment  she gave us it was about giving a feedback on whether you found the English sessions and assignments helpful and valuable

- On my side, I enjoyed  this  English class  a lot and I feel as if I have  learned  a lot of great things that will help me with my writing in the future. I believe I have improved  greatly with my writing skills, mostly in pronouncing words in English, writting, and speaking in front of people.  This English class  helped me to discover my strengths, weaknesses, and difficulties I have to overcome in writing. 

- With all the assignments that I wrote, I noticed that most of my mistakes lie within my grammar usage. When it comes to email writing it becomes a little tricky, because I had to understand what was needed to write about and the style in which I need to write in.

# Conclusion
 - The most important thing I learned was how to organise and write a basic email, put commas,  capitalization, and full stops.
