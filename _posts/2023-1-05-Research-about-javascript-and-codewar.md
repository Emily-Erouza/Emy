# Introduction
- Today I some research in javascript and codewar.To understand more about this following topics.

# Body
- Codewars is a site that has thousands of programming problems you can use to practice what you’ve learned in class.On Codewars these problems are called Kata. A Kata is a little workout. Solving lots of kata gives you lots of practice in:writing JavaScript,breaking down problems,recognising common questions and building up your JavaScript muscles.

- I did a reseach about  JavaScript variables. Variables can be thought of as named containers.Variables are declared with the var keyword, for example: var money;
                               var name;
- The var keyword only for declaration or initialization, once for the life of any variable name in a document. 

## Also there are two types of JavaScript Variable Scope

- Global Variables − A global variable has global scope which means it can be defined anywhere in your JavaScript code.

- Local Variables − A local variable will be visible only within a function where it is defined. Function parameters are always local to that function.

# Conclusion 
- so far is wat i learned about variables. Also google and youtube really helped me a lot.
