# Introduction
- Today I was busy with typing club, react and chess
# Body 
- At the  typing club, my accuracy is good, but the speed is improving so far, even though im too slow.
- speed:29wpm
- Accuracy:100%
## Challenge
- I have some  challenges in typing club. I can't reach 40wpm or 35wpm in speed.
- But i will try so hard so improve my speed. 
- I have challenges in chess, im still learning it, but for me its too difficult. Because i never played chess before. I dont know  the  moves, its too complicated for me.
# Resolution
- I will try to learn the chess in youtube. so that i can improve my skills and  how to win with a checkmate.
