# Introduction
- Today I was busy with bootstrap in FCC.

# Body
- I was busy with checkbox and radiobox. 
- In radio button, I learned that you can use Bootstrap's col-xs-* classes on form elements, too! 
- form-control can add the fa-paper-plane Font Awesome icon by adding <i class="fa fa-paper-plane"></i> within your submit button element.
- Font Awesome is a convenient library of icons. These icons can be webfonts or vector graphics.. You can specify their size using pixels, and they will assume the font size of their parent HTML elements.
      for e.g: <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i>

  # Conclusion
In Bootstrap I learn how to build responsive websites with Bootstrap, and use its included classes to style buttons, images, forms, navigation, and other common elements.
