# Introduction
- Today I did some research about javascript .Which there are things that I dont understand in javascript.

# Body
## I learned about the campirison with Greater than operator,Equal to operator,Inequality operator and Less than operator.how to Write Reusable JavaScript with Functions.

- Where by The equality operator compares two values and returns true if they're equivalent or false if they are not.

- The inequality operator (!=) is the opposite of the equality operator. It means not equal and returns false where equality would return true.

- The greater than operator (>) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

- The less than operator (<) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is less than the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

- In functions i learned about Global Scope and local scope. which are variables that are declared without the let or const keywords they are automatically created in the global scope.

## I learned about the following symbols and how to use them
(==):strict equality
(===):strict equality
(||) : or
" ":strings
