# Introduction
 - Today i learned about Building JavaScript Objects

# Body
- Accessing Object Properties with Dot Notation (.)
- Accessing object properties with bracket notation []
- Accessing obect properties with variables
- Dot notation is what you use when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time.

 # Conclusion
- Bracket notation is the property of the object you are trying to access that has a space in its name.

- Also the bracket notation on objects is to access a property which is stored as the value of a variable.

- I also learned about Updating Object Properties:
1.How to delete properties in javascript,either u use dot or bracket notation.

2.Using Objects for Lookups.Either you use switch statement or if\else chain

## I learned about Testing Objects for Propertie:

- hasOwnProperty(propname)>
which is a method of objects to determine if that object has the given property name.
