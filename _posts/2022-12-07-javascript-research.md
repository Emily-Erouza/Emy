# Intoduction
Today I did some research about javascript .Which there are things that I dont understand in javascript.

# Body
- I learned about differnt types of loops:while loop, for loop,for..of loop.
- loops -are main control structure of javascript.

- I learned about functions. Function is a block of code ,self contained.
- We have differnt  types of functions: Function declaration,
                                        :Function return undefined,
                                        :Arrow function.

 - I also learned  how to join two or more arrays, while using Concat() or Spread operator(...) 
 - How to find a specific item in the array, while using find()- it returns the first item that returns true and returns undefined if the element is not found.
                                                         Include ()-Returns true if a contains value after the position i..

 - We have  for equality opertor : === checker for equality
                                : !== checker for inequality 

- We have primitive types: numbers, strings and boolean 

# Conclusion
 After learning this I was inspired to learn more about JavaScript.
