# Introduction 
- Today I learned about arrays method: pop,push,shift and unshift.

# Body
- A pop() method removes the last element from an array and returns that element.This method change the length of an array.
- A push() method adds one or more elements to the end of an array  and returns the new length of an array.
- A shift() method removes the first element from an array  and returns that removed element.It also change the length of an array.
- Unshift() method adds or more elements to the beginning of an array and retruns the new lenght of an array.
- slice() method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from start to  end,where start and end represent the  index  of items in  that array.
- Splice () method  changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements in place. 

# Conclusion 
The array's object properties and list of array elements are separate, and the array's traversal and mutation operations cannot be applied to these named properties.
