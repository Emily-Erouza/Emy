# Introduction
- Today i learned about Object Oriented Programming
# Body
- Create a Basic JavaScript Object

- Use Dot Notation to Access the Properties of an Object : Dot notation is used on the object name, duck, followed by the name of the property, name, to access the value of Aflac.

- Create a Method on an Object : Methods are properties that are functions. This adds different behavior to an object.

- Make Code More Reusable with the this Keyword.

an example : sayName: function() {return "The name of this duck is " + duck.name + ".";}
If the variable name changes, any code referencing the original name would need to be updated as well. In a short object definition, it isn't a problem, but if an object has many references to its properties there is a greater chance for error.
