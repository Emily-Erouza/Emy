# Introduction
- Today I was busy with  React(FCC)and typing club.
- React is a popular JavaScript library for building reusable, component-driven user interfaces for web pages or applications.

# Body
- Today I learned how to create different React components, manage data in the form of state props.

- I learned how to render Html element to the DOM.With react we can render JSX directly to the HTML DOM using rect's rendering API know as ReactDOM. REST API:stands for Representational State Transfer application programming interface
API  allows API connections between different parts of an application or service over the internet.
 
ReactDOM.render(componentToRender,targetNode)

You can pass it by id='challenge-node'
document.getElementbyId(targetnode)

- I learned how to use className by JSX. In Js you use class, which is a reserved word in Javascript. In JSX you call it className.
function: 
<div className="myDiv"></div>

speed 33wpm
Accuracy 100%

## Challenges
- I had a challenge on how to create component with a function which it return JSX or null.
- example:

const DemoComponent = function(){
return(
<div className="customClass"></div>
);
};


- Also how to create an ES6 class which you extend  the react.component class.In which you add the constructor and super.

# conclusion
- Tomorrow I will continue with React and understand on how this functions works and what they work or mean in a function.
