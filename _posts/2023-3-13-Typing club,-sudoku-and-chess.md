- Today I was busy with typing club, sudoku and chess
# Body 
- I was playing sudoku. I can say the game was challenging and exciting.
- At the  typing club, my accuracy is good, but the speed is improving so far, even though im too slow.
- speed:20wpm
- Accuracy:90%
## Challenge
- I have some  challenges in typing club. I can't reach 40wpm or 35wpm in speed.
- But i will try so hard so improve my speed. 
- I have challenges in chess, im still learning it, but for me its too difficult. Because i never played chess before. I dont know  the  moves, its too complicated for me.
