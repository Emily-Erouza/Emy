# Introduction
- Today I was busy with jQuery in FCC.
-jQuery to select, remove, clone, and modify different elements on the page.

# Body
- jQuery to select, remove, clone, and modify different elements on the page.
- Inside your script element,  we add this code: $(document).ready(function() { to your script.
- The important thing to know is that code you put inside this function will run as soon as your browser has loaded your page.
- $, usually referred to as a dollar sign operator, or as bling.
- For  your button elements bounce: $("button").addClass("animated bounce");
-  When you use jQuery's .addClass() function to add the classes animated and shake, you use this function: $(".text-primary").addClass("animated shake");
-  When you  use jQuery's .addClass() function to add the classes animated and fadeOut, use this function:$("#target6").addClass("animated fadeOut");

## Conclusion
- I ended at target the Same Element with Multiple jQuery Selectors.
