# Introduction

What have i learned.

# Body

Mondli thought me how to open a file when writing a blog post .First thing you creat a file e.g post, write a date , layout ,title and catergorie.Start with an introduction followed by body and end with conclusion.He taught me about about this symbols # and dash(- ). You use # for headings ,dash (-) when you want your words to be in bullete form and you use double hastag(##) when you want to add another title below the heading. He aslo taught me about gifhub.

# conclusion

Finally i have a clue how to create a file in visual studio code.
